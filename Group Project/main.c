/**
 * main.c for Group 4
 *
 * Main file for the EE579 Advanced Microcontroller Applications Group Project
 * Microcontroller I/O feature functionality. Created by members of Group 4.
 *
 * Includes all functionality for Inputs and Outputs specified in the design
 * document (2 buttons, 1 potentiometer, 1 thermometer, 3 lights, and 1 buzzer)
 *
 * Timers are allocated dynamically based on activation of function (input/output)
 * For any initialisation in the same occurrence of a while loop the functionalities
 * will be allocated timers depending on order of first encounter ie:
 * Button 1, Button 2, Potentiometer, Thermometer, LED 1, LED 2, LED 3, Buzzer and
 * their related configurations.
 * The exact order of these can be found in the while loop in the main function.
 *
 * Code in here is based on previous challenges and examples from TI code.

/**
 * Inputs
 *
 * The codes for activation are based on the timers, if value is 0 that means not active, if -1 means disable/deactivate

 * fading in lights which only disable timers and resets the variable, the light will still stay on and this needs to be manually turned off
 * if testing (messages received will do this automatically

	 * Variables for testing
	 * Uncomment the features wanted, then select debug and run. Ensure all external devices are
	 * connected as per the diagram in the design specifications as these will not function otherwise.
	 *
	 * For features connected to inputs the required affecting output needs to be specified
	 * in the timer code for each corresponding input, these can be found in the timer interrupts later
	 * in this file. It is not necessary to specify the wanted output for each timer interrupt,
	 * these are dynamically allocated base on available timers and will therefore allocate the
	 * inputs based on the order in the list below, therefore for example if button 1 was selected,
	 * along with button 2. on this run Button 1 would be allocated Timer A0_1 and button 2 A0_2,
	 * therefore any required output should be activated in those corresponding timers.
	 * If only Button 2 was selected then this would be allocated A0_1.
	 *
	 * The value of the thermometer and the potentiometer can be seen by pausing the running and
	 * selecting expressions in the top right pane. Here the value_temp shows the temperature
	 * value in degrees Celsius, and the value shows the outut from the potentiometer.
	 * There are two other expressions here as well, temp is the value of the thermometer before
	 * the conversion to Celsius, and orig_val is the value of the potentiometer for the previous
	 * measured value that were of a specific step size, in other words the value and orig_val
	 * can show how much the potentiometer value has changed.
	 *
	 * Please note that while any inputs wanted can be selected at once, however this will affect
	 * the timers and hence the availability of the outputs as there are only a possible number
	 * of 5 timer Capture Compare Registers of which 1 is required per each input, and a mix of
	 * 1 and 2 CCR for the outputs depending on functionality, please see the list below for details.
	 * LED is used without a digit here as it is the same for all LEDs
	 *
	 * Those with 1 CCR: LED blink, Buzzer Tone, Buzzer Beep
	 * Those with 2: LED fade in, LED Fade out, LED breathing
	 *
	 * Please note that Buzzer Tone, Fade in, and Fade out will deactivate their timer upon task completion.
	 * Fade In will still remain on after this activation.
	 * Default durations are set in the variable declaration above, the duration is specified in the comments.
	 *
	 * To deactivate any input or output simply assign them a value of -1. For Fading In, as specified,
	 * the light will remain active and this can be turned off in 2 different ways: Set fade out to 1,
	 * set led on to -1.
